		<p>Kern Valley Delivery will be the app to order from multiple local restaurants,
			even if they do not have a website or offer delivery. No longer will
			there be restrictions based on whether or not a restaurant delivers
			in your area (<em>very remote locations may involve an additional fee
			and areas outside of the Kern River Valley are not serviced.</em>)
		</p>
		<p>This will also help support local businesses, especially small restaurants
			that are having difficulty in this time of delivery-only restrictions.
			Instead of each restaurant needing to pay for the infrastructure and
			staff required to offer delivery, they may instead use what is
			provided by Kern Valley Delivery.</p>
